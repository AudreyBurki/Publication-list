# Peer-reviewd articles
(A subset of papers can be found on [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Audrey_Buerki), e-mail me if you cannot find the one you are looking for. The datasets and code for my most recent studies are on [OSF](https://osf.io/c6v0t/), I will add more in the (hopefully) near future
